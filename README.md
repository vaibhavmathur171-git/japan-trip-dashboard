# Japan Trip Dashboard (SFO → Japan)

This is a small static dashboard intended for GitHub Pages.

## Publish
- Repo: https://github.com/vaibhavmathur171-git/japan-trip-dashboard
- Pages: will be enabled after first push.

## Files
- `index.html` — dashboard UI
- `data.json` — structured dataset (date windows + fares + weather summaries)

## Voting & comments
Because GitHub Pages is static, voting/comments are embedded using a third-party form/poll URL (e.g., Tally). Update `data.json` fields:
- `meta.pollEmbedUrl`
- `meta.commentsEmbedUrl`

Then the dashboard will show them.
